## Story research
* It's too early to successfully collect data on how the end of race-based college admissions shaped college demographics. However, I'm still interestd in this general topic. I'm curious about two related matters. First, how many colleges are still using race to consider college admissions through their application? For example, has there been an increase in DEI questions on college applications this year in comparison to previous years?
* I think I could measure this by starting a list of all the universities that pledged their committment to racial diversity after the ruling. I could find emails. I could also set a rule for myself to only look into colleges with more than 15,000 students in order to narrow my search.
* Consideration of race and ethnicity is more likely among private colleges, according to a July study from [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/14/private-selective-colleges-are-most-likely-to-use-race-ethnicity-as-a-factor-in-admissions-decisions/#:~:text=All%20but%2010%20of%20the,it%20as%20an%20important%20factor.).
* This same research article cited the Common Data Set, which could also be helpful background for this project. Looking at the CDC will show me what schools categorize race as an "important" or "very important" consideration for admission. The schools that value it most are among the ones that I could consider. 
* With this list, I could check in on these colleges and compare their application questions from the last five years to this year. Again, has there been an uptick in seeking answers about a prospective student's racial diversity?
* Then, to take it a step further, I could look into how many of these schools have ended legacy admissions or thought of ending the legacy admissions.
* More than 100 universities stopped considering legacy applicants from 2015 to 2022, according to nonpartisan national thinktank, Education Reform Now.
* I worry about possible biases from sources that could skew the data
* While this wouldn't exactly answer my initial question of racial demographic changes, this could certainly help paint a picture for better understanding any changes that might be ocurring right now.

The National Center for Education Statistics ](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/equity/indicator_d8.asp)https://nces.ed.gov/programs/equity/indicator_d8.asp
* This is a part of the annual report from August. This specific section I linked focuses on disparities in studentsâ€™ exposure to racial, ethnic and economic segregation. NCES is a government-run sector, which is what establishes their credibility. This dataset could be useful in background for my article because it highlights the exisiting disparities for K-12 students in American public schools. It could be beneficial to compare this with research on how quality of education can determine if students are able to attend college. At the very least, it's useful for understanding the current groups of students that will be entering college in the next few years.
* [Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/about/reports-and-insights)https://www.commonapp.org/about/reports-and-insights
* Common App is reputable because its the application typically used among those looking to pursue an undergraduate degree. It has a lot of public progress reports that I find interesting. The one that stands out the most to me for the purpose of this project is from September 2022, called "Long-term progress toward diversifying the Common App applicant pool."
* The dataset that interests me the most is figure four, which looks at the increase in applicants from lower incomes in the past decade. Again, I think this is similar to the NCES statistics where we can see that there are efforts to improve accessibility to the college admissions process.
* Overall, I know this isn't a perfect pitch. However, I feel like I'm narrowing in. It isn't possible to see how the end of race-based consideration in college admissions will affect the demographics. But, it's possible to see what tools students that could be affected by the Court's decision have, as well as the potential risks they face when applying to college.
