## Story research
* It's too early to successfully collect data on how the end of race-based college admissions shaped college demographics. However, I'm still interestd in this general topic. I'm curious about two related matters. First, how many colleges are still using race to consider college admissions through their application? For example, has there been an increase in DEI questions on college applications this year in comparison to previous years?
* I think I could measure this by starting a list of all the universities that pledged their committment to racial diversity after the ruling. I could find emails. I could also set a rule for myself to only look into colleges with more than 15,000 students in order to narrow my search.
* With this list, I could check in on these colleges and compare their application questions from the last five years to this year. Again, has there been an uptick in seeking answers about a prospective student's racial diversity?
* Then, to take it a step further, I could look into how many of these schools have ended legacy admissions or thought of ending the legacy admissions.
* When I started looking into the topic of universities that ended legacy admissions, I found some information. A lot of this information is presented with an agenda. So, for example I learned that 
* While this wouldn't exactly answer my initial question of racial demographic changes, this could certainly help paint a picture for better understanding any changes that might be ocurring right now.
