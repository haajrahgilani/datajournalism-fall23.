I used the data from the [National Center for Education Statistics ](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_501.30.asp) annual report. 
* The dataset lists the percentage and number of people 18 to 24 years old who were neither enrolled in school nor working, by age group, high school completion status, sex, and race/ethnicity from selected years, 2006 through 2021.
* 
* I'm interested in race and ethnicity, so I focused specifically on that.
* I made a tab on Excel that only looked at the selected years from 2006 - 2021 and the percent races/ethnicities of people from 18 - 24 who were not enrolled in school nor working.
* So, while I also cleaned up the columns, I also ended up narrowing the data.
* Because I knew that I was going to narrow the data, I didn't copy and paste the initial dataset. I just began a new tab and copied and pasted what I needed from it.
* In my pivot table, I tried to ask, "Which racial/ethnic group had the biggest change from 2006 to 2021?"
* Hispanic 18 - 24 year olds had the biggest change in the recorded years. In 2006,  almost 21% of people in this age group were not in school or employed. In 2021, there were about 17%. I don't know if that's a significant decrease. However, it's the largest among any other group.
* Obviously, there are barriers to work and higher education that are specific to each race. However, it's interesting to note this decrease in the Hispanic population and it sparks additional follow up questions.
* Some of these other questions include, "did Hispanic people in this age group enter the workforce or higher education?" "What caused this decrease?" "Why did other groups remain relatively stagnant?"
