The story should answer an interesting question using data. The data component of the story must be substantial, and you need to dig into the dataset. If you just read toplines off a website without actually finding and downloading or creating a dataset, that is insufficient.

The pitch should include (at minimum):

The steps used to analyze the data
Findings from the data, including a proposed nut graf
The data sources
Plans for how you would report and structure this story if given more time
