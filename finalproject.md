# QUESTION
* How is the new era of "race blind" college admissions, changing  the universities that said they value racial diversity?

# PITCH
* When the Supreme Court of the United States ruled to end the decades-long practice of race-conscious affirmative action, it ushered in a new era for education. This new process of "race-blind" college admissions left many students and civil rights advocates alike wondering what this will mean for racial diversity at higher education institutions. While it's too early to fully comprehend the impact of ending this admissions practice, it's not too early to know what schools to monitor.
* When I say _monitor_, I refer to universities that have historically considered race in their admissions process-- with some of these schools even describing race and ethnicity as important factors in considering an applicant. What does it mean when these insitutions consider race/ethnicity? Does that consideration reflect in their student body demographics? How will this SCOTUS decision affect their approach?

## LIMITATIONS
* If I had more time, I would create a longer, more extensive database of universities. For the purpose of this project, I looked at 100 of the most selective institutions in the country, particularly because experts [predicted](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-explained-students-diversity) "the decision's effects are expected to be felt immediately at elite and selective universities." 
* Additionally, with more time, this story would include many interviews with university officials, students, educators and civil rights advocates. Has the campus atmosphere changed when it comes to racial diversity? For campus admissions, were there new approaches to creating the 2024-2025 college application? Many experts suggested outreach is now the best way to seek racial diversity in colleges, what has that looked like?

## STEPS TAKEN
1. I began by looking for 100 of the most selective universities in the country. I used a list from [U.S. News & World Report ](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/lowest-acceptance-rate) that used the schools' most recent acceptance rates to compile this ranking. For schools I was unsure about, I fact-checked that these acceptance rates were reported by other sources as well.
2. Once I added the 100 schools to a spreadsheet, I started looking for their Common Data Set (CDS) responses. The Common Data Set is a data collaboratiion led by the College Board, Petersonâ€™s, and U.S. News & World Report. Universities typically complete a form annually and publish the information on their website.
* The majority of the schools I examined completed this form, but not all schools completed it to reflect the 2022-23 academic year. For this reason, I only looked at the 2021-22 term.
3. Under the race/ethnicity section of the form, there is a question that asks the institutions to determine how important of a factor racial/ethnic status is in applicant consideration.
* The form reads, "Relative importance of each of the following academic and nonacademic factors in your first-time, firstyear, degree-seeking (freshman) admission decisions." The options are:
  * Very important
  * Important
  * Considered
  * Not considered 

## Proposed nut graf
* 
  
The story should answer an interesting question using data. The data component of the story must be substantial, and you need to dig into the dataset. If you just read toplines off a website without actually finding and downloading or creating a dataset, that is insufficient.

The pitch should include (at minimum):

The steps used to analyze the data
Findings from the data, including a proposed nut graf
The data sources
Plans for how you would report and structure this story if given more time
