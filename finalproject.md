# QUESTION
* The big picture question is: How is the new era of "race blind" college admissions, changing  the universities that said they value racial diversity?
* However, the question for this assignment, which I view as a piece of answering that larger question, is: **What role has racial/ethnic status played in the recent, but pre-Students for Fair Admissions, history in the admissions process for premier universities in the United States? 
**
# PITCH
* When the Supreme Court of the United States ruled to end the decades-long practice of race-conscious affirmative action, it ushered in a new era for education. This new process of "race-blind" college admissions left many students and civil rights advocates alike wondering what this will mean for racial diversity at higher education institutions. While it's too early to fully comprehend the impact of ending this admissions practice, it's not too early to know what schools to monitor.
* When I say _monitor_, I refer to universities that have historically considered race in their admissions process-- with some of these schools even describing race and ethnicity as important factors in considering an applicant. What does it mean when these insitutions consider race/ethnicity? Does that consideration reflect in their student body demographics? How will this SCOTUS decision affect their approach?

## LIMITATIONS
* If I had more time, I would create a longer, more extensive database of universities. For the purpose of this project, I looked at 100 of the most selective institutions in the country, particularly because experts [predicted](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-explained-students-diversity) "the decision's effects are expected to be felt immediately at elite and selective universities."
* The most selective universities included military schools, which are not affected by the SCOTUS decision. Additionally, not all universities posted Common Data Set responses and I contacted them as well to request that information. I excluded these from my data visualizations. In the end, I **found relevant data for 74 universities.**
* Additionally, with more time, this story would include many interviews with university officials, students, educators and civil rights advocates. Has the campus atmosphere changed when it comes to racial diversity? For campus admissions, were there new approaches to creating the 2024-2025 college application? Many experts suggested outreach is now the best way to seek racial diversity in colleges, what has that looked like?
* This data set includes public schools in states that have already banned affirmative action before the SCOTUS decision. For example, there are California schools. While there are private institutions, like California Institute of Technology, there are also four University of California branches on the list. Because of the state's ban, these public schools have not been considering race for decades now. 

## STEPS TAKEN
1. I began by looking for 100 of the most selective universities in the country. I used a list from [U.S. News & World Report ](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/lowest-acceptance-rate) that used the schools' most recent acceptance rates to compile this ranking. For schools I was unsure about, I fact-checked that these acceptance rates were reported by other sources as well.
2. Once I added the 100 schools to a spreadsheet, I started looking for their [Common Data Set](https://commondataset.org/) (CDS) responses. The Common Data Set is a data collaboratiion led by the College Board, Petersonâ€™s, and U.S. News & World Report. Universities typically complete a form annually and publish the information on their website.
* The majority of the schools I examined completed this form, but not all schools completed it to reflect the 2022-23 academic year. For this reason, I only looked at the 2021-22 term.
3. Under the race/ethnicity section of the form, there is a question that asks the institutions to determine how important of a factor racial/ethnic status is in applicant consideration. I searched for every university on my spreadsheet's response to this question.
* The form reads, "Relative importance of each of the following academic and nonacademic factors in your first-time, firstyear, degree-seeking (freshman) admission decisions." The options are:
  * Very important
  * Important
  * Considered
  * Not considered
4. After I made my way through every available Common Data Set response, I indicated each university's level of consideration of race on the spreadsheet. When I completed this, I was ready to create my first visualization. For this visualization, I presented an overview of my findings.
* The biggest takeaway was that the majority of these selective institutions reported that racial/ethnic status was considered. 
* Only 8 schools said it was not considered.
* I wanted the first visualization to be simple and easy to follow. I think the topic is quite complex because of how new it is. With the exception of the few states that banned affirmative action prior to the SCOTUS decision, this is the first time in most admissions officers career that race is no longer a considerable factor. The story would be filled with lots of nuances, so I believe the first data visualization should be easy for anyone to comprehend.
5. I know the second visualization has severe limitations. This is another aspect of my project that would benefit from more time. The biggest limitation is that I only looked at 12 universities for this visualization and this is because I had to narrow down my list of 74. This could be fixed by the aforementioned longer, more extensive list.
* Limitations aside, I began a new tab for this second visualizaton. Here, I only included the schools that selected the answers on the opposite ends of the spectrum. No university said racial/ethnic status was "very important." However, seven universities marked that it was "important."
* In contrast, eight universities marked that racial/ethnic status was "not considered."
6. With this new tab of the schools that said racial/ethnic status was either "important" or "not considered," I went to the National Center for Education Statistics. I looked at the [NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System	](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/institutionprofile.aspx?unitId=190150&goToReportId=6&sid=a8ac66d4-e600-4ed3-bd53-9975c9469f64&rtid=6)(IPEDS) reports for each institution.
  * Another limitation is that I could not find Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System for every university on the list. However, it worked out fairly. I found six reports for the schools in the "important" category and six for the "not considered category."
  * The IPEDS reports listed the racial breakdown of the universities' student bodies. I made note of all of them.
  * After making note of the demographics in each university, I made another tab. In this new tab, I took the average for every racial/ethnic category. So, for example, I found the average for Asian students in schools in the "important" category. And, I found the average for Asian students in schools in the "not considered" category.
  * With these averages, I created the second visualization.
 7. When I was putting this chart together, I had to sit with the takeaway for a while. Again, I want to acknowledge the limitation regarding California. The data I was working with included four different University of California branches: Los Angeles, Berkeley, Irvine and San Diego. In a real article, I would be sure to include a sample size of more than just 12 schools, especially when four of those schools are the same university system and in same state. I view this as more of a model for what a future visualization on this topic could look like with more time!
 * With those constraints acknowledged, I noticed that there isn't a drastic difference in the demographics. There were some constants throughout in both the "important" and "not considered" categories. These constants included:
 * American Indian/Alaska Native students and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander were not represented at all in any of the institutions.
 * Black students always accounted for less than 10% of the population. The same is true for biracial/multiracial students and students with an unknown/undisclosed identity.
 * The location of the school matters as well. California has the [highest](https://www.statista.com/statistics/259850/hispanic-population-of-the-us-by-state/#:~:text=Hispanic%20population%20U.S.%202022%2C%20by%20state&text=In%202022%2C%20California%20had%20the,Hispanic%20residents%20in%20that%20year.) Hispanic population, so it's not a stretch that the largest percentages of Hispanic students would be from the California universities.
 * With all of these limitations, I understand why this chart may come across as misleading. However, I would never put this chart up without an exhaustive analysis derived from interviews. For example, if I had a larger list of schools and the findings were similar to this: that the racial demographic didn't seem all that different whether a school considered racial/ethnic status, I would ask, "why?" Is it because of the locations of the universities, aka a reflection of the state they're in? If so, is the university in question working on outreach to appeal to communities that aren't being represented? If the university said it considers race, how much consideration do they place on it? Do the student body demographics reflect the application demographics?
   
    
## Proposed nut graf
* 
  
The story should answer an interesting question using data. The data component of the story must be substantial, and you need to dig into the dataset. If you just read toplines off a website without actually finding and downloading or creating a dataset, that is insufficient.

The pitch should include (at minimum):

The steps used to analyze the data
Findings from the data, including a proposed nut graf
The data sources
Plans for how you would report and structure this story if given more time
