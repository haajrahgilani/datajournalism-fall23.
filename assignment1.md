## Clarity and accuracy 
* **Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.**
* 5-- I instantly knew this was a piece providing insight to the hazardous conditions inside Philadelphia schools. While the lede took some time setting the scene, I knew what to expect even before that after seeing the headline, photo and subheading. 
  *  What was it?
   * The entral insight is that Philadelphia children are at risk because their schools have toxic and unsafe conditions, like mold, asbestos and lead-filled peeling paint. 
  *  * Was it in the headline?
     * Yes. While "Danger, learn at your own risk" is vague, the project title "Toxic City, Sick Schools" right at the top helps to inform readers what to expect in the article
* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent
 * 4. The article used two data tables. One displayed lead dust in Philadelphia schools and the other displayed lead in the drinking water. It was definitely very easy to read because it included three factors- the school, the location of the lead and how much was found. Both tables had varying shades, with the bottom of the table having a lighter color and the top with the higher amounts of lead having a darker color. It was very easy to read and comprehend both tables.
 * Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?
  * I think it was definitely the most efficient way. However, I still think it would have been helpful to visualize an amount of lead that isn't hazardous versus the conditions in Philadelphia schools. There could have been a third seperate dataset that did this, in my opinion.
 * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?
  * It's also somewhat annoying that the two data tables don't break up the text. They're just to the side of the text as the story continues, so you have to break your immersion to look at them. I would center the data sets or at least only include them at the end of a section so they're less distracting. 
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
 * 4. I wouldn't expect any data to be 100 percent perfect because there are always other factors to consider, like the margin of error. However, two newspaper staffs worked together in 19 schools to look into the data and that is quite reassuring. A lot of the data also came from the city itself, like how much they spent and how old the school buildings are, so those public records that anyone could fact check reaffirm my trust in the investigation. 
 * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
  * I might be weary on some of the sampling of elementary school dust. The article said that reporters had staffers at elementary schools follow EPA-approved protocol to collect dust. This is gthe only time where "EPA-approved protocol" is mentioned, but that also might just be a stylistic choice. Regardless, I wonder if it's better to have an environmental specialist collect this information or if someone with less expertise may be more prone to errors. There were 14 schools, so did all staffers do this the exact same way? Also, I am somewhat confused as to who the staffers are-- I assume it's employees of the school, but I wish it was clearer and that I didn't have to assume. 
 * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.
  * I would have liked to have an environmental or a medical expert weight in on the story. I would trust the story more if an expert could analyze the investigation's findings or discuss the student-cases included in the piece. 
 * Did they provide a source?
  * The article refers to the EPA when calling levels toxic. However, there isn't anything outside of the public EPA information, to my understanding, that they use. There is not one individual any of this information is attributed to.
 * Did they explain everything that needed explaining?
  * Again, I think showing what normal school functions should be like would be helpful. What do schools outside of the city look like? I think getting Montgomery, Bucks or Chester county schools to compare could have helped illustrate concepts in the piece better.

## Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
  * 3.5.
 * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.
  * The story really thrives with its anecdotes and personal testimonies. The narrative is really compelling throughout and it's easy to establish connections with the sources. Where I get weary is the data. Again, I would have liked expert sources. I also would appreciate a comparison to other schools. More insight into what went into collecting these samples may have been useful. However, this is just one article in an entire series, so I don't want to come down too strictly on that because it's possible that these were explored in other stories. In that case, I would like a reference to a landing page that contains all the stories from this project.

## Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
 * For example, did it:
  * Look like it all belonged together?
  * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
  * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)
* 4.
 * Explain
 * This is a serious story, so the simple font choices were for the best. Still, even with that simplicity, there are some creative decisions I appreciate. In every new section, the subheading is entirely capitalized. Then, the first letter of the new section is several times larger than the rest of the text. Certain words are italicized for emphasis. Two quotes are emphasized through all-caps and big, bold text, which is magazine-like and helpful for highlighting good quotes. The font definitely looked like it all belonged together.
* Color (1-5)
 * 3.5. 
 * Explain
  * There was a lot of congruence with the color. Every new section starts with a subheading in a yellow box, which is reminicent of a school bus. There is also a yellow outline around some images. I appreciate the consistency and simplicity of the yellow because it adds a flair to the story without overwhelming it. The two data tables are also color-coded and, again, that really helped my comprehension. In the first table, yellow was okay and red was dangerous. However, in the second table, there were only lighter and darker shades of purple. I think this might help differentiate the two tables, but the yellow-red was more helpful because it's eaasier to see a change and I would've liked to see that again in the second table.

## Creativity
* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
  * Somewhat. 
 * How?
  *  Again, I know this is an entire series. This article didn't take daring creative strides. However, there is a link to another story in this investigation inserted halfway through this piece that I found really interesting; it's photos of school conditions throughout the last three years. I like how much space it takes up, so even without clicking on it, you're still able to see some photos and you're definitely thinking about it. However, for this story specifically, the visuals aren't distracting by any means. The narrative elements are my favorite parts of the story, so the photos of the people mentioned in the story only strengthen their quotes.
 * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.
  * 5.
